[Mateus Girafa Lachtermacher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateus-girafa-lachtermacher-8b487110b/?originalSubdomain=br) advocates for social dialogue and evidence-based policymaking in order to improve the SDGs, especially 1 and 2. He specialized in data for economic policies, poverty reduction, financial inclusion, and rural development.
His role at DIAL is to support the expansion of the Catalog of Digital Solutions and the Digital Principles. Since he entered in March 2022, Mateus has been helping mainly with the open data, playbooks, organizations and products tabs of the Catalog, and on data about the Digital Principles endorsers and the new intake form for potential endorsers. Mateus comes to DIAL with experience in international contexts and multilateral organizations, such as a field research coordinator at USP, Jr Technical Officer at ILO, and data intern at ENPARD, UNDP Georgia’s rural development program. His formation, with an Erasmus Joint Master Degree, was complemented by internships and voluntary experiences across Brazil in the areas of financial democratization, education, and slums development, currently coordinating a voluntary community team in a slum in Duque de Caxias (RJ).

[Arjumand Younus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjumand-younus-b6437a7/) is an Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science at University College Dublin (UCD). Before returning to UCD, Prof. Arjumand Younus worked as a Research Scientist in Afiniti AI, and a part-time lecturer at Technological University Dublin. Arjumand has contributed to SFI funded projects during her different post-doctoral positions at CONSUS-UCD and INSIGHT-UCD. She is also serving in the capacity of co-director for Women in Research Ireland which is a volunteer-run registered charity working for better representation of women and under-represented groups in academia.

Arjumand received a joint PhD in Computer Science from National University of Ireland Galway (Ireland) and University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy), MS degree in Computer Science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (South Korea), and BS in Computer Science from the University of Karachi (Pakistan). Her research focuses on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Data Science for Social Good. Arjumand is passionate about the value of artificial intelligence technology to make society better, and at the moment is involved as an academic partner in various AI for Social Good projects.

### Week 4

#### Stakeholder Communication

- Session description 

How do you get people to support your data science solution? And how do you ensure that decision makers can use the insights that come from your data? Effective communication can help you to get management, colleagues and other stakeholders on board with your data science project. In this session, you will learn the most important practices in engaging your stakeholders and apply this to your own data science project.

### Week 5

#### Text Mining Specialization

##### Managing Medium Sized Datasets without Making your Brain Melt

- Session description

Small datasets can usually be loaded entirely into memory, even on commodity hardware, and working with very large datasets usually calls for distributed computation approaches. Somewhere in the middle however, are cases where there is too much to work with on a single machine, but a distributed approach isn't justified with cost or complexity. This tutorial explores tricks and techniques for working with this kind of "medium" sized data, that's too big to trivially process, but not big enough to warrant a more complex deployment.
