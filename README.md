### Analytics Translators (4 Days)
 
Analytics Translators are a crucial part of project teams at non-profits, who work in projects with a data and digital components. Analytics Translators are not data scientists, engineers or architects.  They’re not even necessarily dedicated analytics professionals and they are not expected to develop models or even know programming. Instead, they play a critical role in bridging the technical expertise of data engineers and data scientists with the operational expertise of humanitarian response, monitoring and evaluation, impact assessment, climate risks and vulnerability, etc. which are very relevant to the activities of your non-profit’s agenda. In their role, translators help ensure that the deep insights generated through sophisticated analytics translate into impact at scale and make sure Analytics is not done for analytics’ sake, but is integrated into the decision-making process.
